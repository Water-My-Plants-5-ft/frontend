Water My Plants

WaterMyPlants will remind users when it's time to feed that foliage and quench your plants' thirst. Ensuring that all your plants are consistently watered is actually pretty difficult. Water My Plants is an app that helps to solve those problems.

This is an app designed during a Lambda School build week.
